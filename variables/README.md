# Variables Directory

This directory is intended to store the geospatial datasets used in this project. These datasets are essential for the analysis but have not been uploaded directly to this GitHub repository due to their large file size (each file is several hundred MB or more). GitHub has a file size limit, and large binary files are generally not suitable for version control here.

To ensure the project remains accessible and reproducible, all required `.tif` files have been uploaded to a public Google Drive folder. You can download them using the link provided below.

## How to Use
